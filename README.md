This is a project I made to learn how to use API's and JSON. It was my first experience using either, and although the project is very simple, I'm happy with the result. My prior knowledge of API's was very abstract; it was a concept I couldn't really wrap my mind around until I actually used one. After researching several that I could possibly use, I decided to use the Art Institute of Chicago's API because the Art Institute is a place I've visited and enjoy very much. 

The most difficult part of this project was learning how to pull the desired information from the API. This process is rather technical, though it ultimately doesn't require all that much code. Learning how to use the XMLHttpRequest and parse the JSON took some slowing down and examinning each keyword used one by one, but once I comprehended, it all made sense. 

In the future, I'd like to continue making modifications to the design and layout of this page.
